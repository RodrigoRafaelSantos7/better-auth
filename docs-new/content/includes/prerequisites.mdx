  ### Create a Convex project

You'll first need a [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) project. If you don't have
one, run `npm create convex@latest` to get started, and [check out the
docs](https://docs.convex.dev/home) to learn more.

  ### Run `convex dev`

Running the cli during setup will initialize your Convex deployment if it
doesn't already exist, and keeps generated types current through the process.
Keep it running.

```npm
npx convex dev
```
