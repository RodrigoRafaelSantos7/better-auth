## Better Auth guide

Better Auth's [basic usage guide](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/basic-usage)
applies to Convex as well. It covers signing in and out, social providers,
plugins, and more. You will be using Better Auth directly in your
project, so their guides are a primary reference.

### Exceptions

There are a few areas in the Better Auth basic usage guide that work differently
in Convex.

- #### Server side authentication

  Better Auth supports signing users in and out through server side functions. Because
  Convex functions run over websockets and don't return HTTP responses or set
  cookies, signing up/in/out must be done from the client via
  `authClient.signIn.*` methods.

- #### Schemas and migrations

  The basic usage guide includes information on database schema generation and
  migrations via the Better Auth CLI. This only applies for [local
  installs](/replace-url), which support generating schemas. For projects not
  using local install, the default schema provided with the Better Auth
  component (preconfigured with the [officially supported
  plugins](/replace-url)) is used, and cannot be altered.

## Using server methods with `auth.api`
